        <div class="paragraph">
            In today's world, information is abundant and choices are endless, but with it there is a great risk associated : deceptive marketing, which has become a pervasive issue. It's a practice where companies use misleading or false advertising to influence consumer behavior, often leading to decisions that are <span class="underline">not in the best interest</span> of the consumer.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Globally, deceptive advertising costs consumers an estimated $50 billion every year, with 80% of these ads spreading through digital platforms. Moreover, surveys show that around 90% of consumers say they have felt misled or deceived by advertising at least once, making it a serious issue.

        <div class="chapter-heading">What Is Deceptive Marketing?</div>

        <div class="paragraph">Deceptive marketing refers to any advertising or promotional activity that misleads consumers by providing false, incomplete, or exaggerated information about a product or service. This can include overstating benefits, hiding critical details, or using manipulative tactics to create a false impression of value or quality. The American Marketing Association defines deceptive advertising as "advertising intended to mislead consumers by falsely making claims, by failure to make full disclosure, or by both".</div>
