           Europe has strict consumer protection laws, yet deception finds another way: the fine print. Techniques like “miracle” or “100% natural” rarely work in this land. The most common sectors where fine print works are airline, hotels, cab services, motels, etc. where the company offers very low prices in order to draw customers to it and then the customers are charged extra as other service charges or other hidden fees. Fees like baggage fee, seat selection fees, and airport taxes are asked in different layers which becomes a deception for the innocent customers. This is the method of deception not only because of the hidden fees but also the way of charging extra is framed in advance. Although the Trade unions want these transactions to be transparent, the company finds a hidden way to deceive the customer. However, the European Association has directed companies to display the full pricing at once, these companies find new tactics to allure the customers and make them pay extra step wise.

         <strong>Why it works:</strong> Travelers are drawn to low upfront costs and overlook hidden charges. The company includes these extra costs hidden somewhere in terms and conditions that are not seen by the customers and often falls for it. Even the details are kept in confusing ways and are hidden from the consumers, bypassing the legal system. The customers are often made to go through the long booking process that they are unwilling to cancel the whole process rather they tend to pay extra as they had spent much time on it. Automatic renewals often play a role in deceptions that do not notify the customers that the service has renewed due to which the money keeps on flowing in utilizing the service.

            <strong>The hook:</strong> Legal wording in small text gives companies cover, even though most people never read it. The company often displays “ONLY €XX” which catches the attention of the consumer. Messages like “ Only 2 items left”, “ Hurry Up” tend to drive the customers' intention to use the service, sensing that the service might be high in demand. Also the tricky and confusing cancellation process is not informed to the customers instead they advertise the service booking to be “ flexible”.

            <strong>Example:</strong> A flight advertised for €29 ends up costing €120 after luggage and “service” fees are added. In mid-2024, Spain’s Consumer Rights Ministry issued massive fines—totalling €150 million—to four major low-cost carriers: Ryanair, EasyJet, Vueling, and Volotea. The penalties targeted practices deemed "abusive", such as charging customers extra for cabin luggage, seat reservations (especially when traveling with children or dependents), reprinting boarding passes, and restricting cash payments at the airport. These actions were found to be both non-transparent and disproportionate.
