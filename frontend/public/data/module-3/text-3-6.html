      Each group should share their findings. This exercise reveals that while deceptive marketing wears different clothes in different cultures, the core strategy remains the same everywhere.
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
Deceptive marketing thrives because it adapts to its audience. It undermines consumer trust, distorts informed decision-making, and perpetuates inequality across all regions. Combating these practices requires strict legal enforcement, global awareness campaigns, ethical business practices, and an educated, vigilant consumer base. Knowing how it works in different regions not only makes us smarter consumers but also prepares us to recognize the same tricks in new forms. The best defense against deception is awareness.
