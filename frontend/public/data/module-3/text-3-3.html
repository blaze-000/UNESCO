           The geographical condition of Africa hinders the proper agricultural growth and the lands can often be observed to be dry, affected by drought and hence famine is a great problem there. Therefore, agriculture based industries often allure the farmers with so-called “miracle seed” or “magic fertilizers” that promise high yield, better resistance against pests and faster growth. However, most of these products fail to deliver. According to a 2019 study conducted by the African Seed Trade Association, 50% of the seeds sold in the informal market in Sub- Saharan Africa are either fake or of poor quality. Similarly, the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) has reported cases where fertilizers labeled as “improved” or “high-yield” were found to be diluted or mixed with low-grade substances, making them far less effective than advertised.

        <div class="paragraph">
         <strong>Why it works:</strong> Hope is a powerful force when livelihoods depend on crops. This deception works because most smallholder farmers—who make up about 60% of the agricultural workforce in Africa—do not have access to reliable testing, depend on word of mouth, and often buy inputs from informal vendors. Also, half of the agricultural goods are imported from the informal market where the regulation is very weak. Bright labels, endorsements by local leaders give these products a sense of legitimacy and can simply convince the farmers.

            <strong>The hook:</strong> The word “miracle” taps into urgency and desperation. Words like “genetically enhanced” and “climate proof” that sound technical are often used to win the customers' trust. The portion of people who are uneducated often finds it more attractive and are easily convinced. The packets are visibly bright and made attractive so that it could be easily observed and the fake data are written in bold letters that catches the eyes of the buyer and hence tend to buy these products without further investigation. The packets are often made cheap and affordable so that poor farmers can buy it easily and do not think of the further effect due to its affordability and short term benefits.

            <strong>Example:</strong> A packet of “magic maize seeds” may be ordinary seed, but the label convinces farmers that it guarantees higher yield. According to the researchers from Tanzania's Ministry of Agriculture in partnership with Sokoine University and University of Maryland, around 40% of the fertilizers sold across Tanzania was substandard. These low quality fertilizers not only harm the fields by lowering its growth rate but also make the pests grow.
