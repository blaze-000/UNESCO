      According to Al-Bayati and Al-Rabaiwi (2020), deceptive marketing is a
      deliberate strategy used to conceal a product’s ﬂaws,invent attributes
      that the product does not possess, or alter how the product is presented
      to customers.Deceptive marketing is not tied to one country or culture. It
      takes different forms depending on what people value, what they fear, and
      what they hope to gain. The beliefs of people living in a particular
      region are targeted through deceptive techniques. A word that convinces
      buyers in Asia may not work in Europe. A trick that draws farmers in
      Africa may not resonate with city dwellers in Latin America. The key is
      this: while the logic of deception remains the same—using half-truths,
      emotional appeal, or hidden costs—the cultural disguise changes.
