          Latin America has one of the fastest-growing social media markets. Here, influencers shape fashion, lifestyle, and even health trends. The influencers often advertise the product without disclosing that they are being paid or sponsored and show as if they used it for themselves due to which their large followers also try to imitate their habit as they are influenced by their virtual lifestyle. Also the study shows that these people have the highest rate of using social media per day i.e. 3-4 hours per day on social media which makes these people highly influenced by the fake social media influencers. Influencers present paid promotion as their personal recommendation. Mostly used platforms by these fake influencers are cryptocurrency, weight loss products, skin care products, brands for shopping etc. In many cases the written hashtags like #ad, #sponsored are kept hidden in the description section. Some governments, like Brazil’s CONAR (National Council for Advertising Self- Regulation), have guidelines that regulate these bodies but they often rely on customers' complaints rather than being self active. In short, the deceptive nature of influencer promotions in Latin America lies not just in the content but in the illusion of authenticity.

        <div class="paragraph">
         <strong>Why it works:</strong> Followers trust influencers as if they were friends, not advertisers. Word of mouth often works in Latin America and is highly valued. Therefore, the products are spread among the public via this means intentionally. Influencers use local slang, dialects, and humors to convince the public that sounds familiar to them and can easily trust the influences and fall for these traps.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <strong>The hook:</strong>The line between genuine advice and paid promotion is blurred. Also the “I use it everyday” claims makes it look authentic and are easily replicated by the people. Similarly, the before and after photos of the influencer that are easily spread on the internet drags the focus of the general consumers which makes the beauty products seem  easily authentic. Influencers share “special codes” via their channels to their subscribers which makes them believe that they are really getting discounts on the products and hence they rush to buy these products. Followers are invited by the influencers to “join the movements” or “be the part of the Family’ playing with the follower’s sentiments  to allure them. Also, the influencers run “Giveaways” and “Freebies contests” on their channels which are conditional offers and are asked to share the advertisements  with others.

            <strong>Example:</strong>An influencer recommending a “miracle weight-loss tea” may be sponsored, but the audience believes it is a personal tip. The Colombian Consumer Protection Authority (part of the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce) launched several investigations into high-profile influencers for misleading conduct:

         <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Yina Calderón:</strong> Penalized for failing to clearly disclose product pricing and exchange policies.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Yeferson Cossio:</strong>Investigated for making unsubstantiated claims about his "Cossio Method" for monetizing social media.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Luisa Castro and Mariam Obregón:</strong> Required to disclose connections with financial service promotions—issues included promoting money collection services without authorization from the Financial Superintendence and failing to declare ties with advertisers.
