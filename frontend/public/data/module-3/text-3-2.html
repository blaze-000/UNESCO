            Asian consumers believe in “Natural Healing” and "Ayurveda". More than any synthetic products, people here accept natural or nature based products. A huge population practises yoga and follows its practitioner. Therefore, some self made yoga teachers have the upper hand in business. Sellers often use these general habits and beliefs of the population to sell their product. According to a 2022 study by Euromonitor, the herbal beauty and personal care product market was 20 Billion USD and is increasing by 8% every year which explains why the sellers are in a rush to introduce their product in the market. The fact that most of the customers do not read the ingredients used but blindly trusts the outer covering of the products makes it helpful for the sellers to lie to the customers.

         <strong>Why it works:</strong> Centuries of cultural belief in nature-based cures create instant credibility. Furthermore, the growing rate of middle class people in Asia who are interested in using healthier products, falls for these traps. These traps are still prevailing in Asian countries due to the lack of proper regulations and punishments for the fraudulent.

            <strong>The hook:</strong> Buyers assume natural equals safe, even without scientific proof. The product is often described as a medicine or using wisdom angles like ancient connections giving it instant aura of trust and authority. The green bottle theme often allure the consumers and connects it with the nature. The sellers also use words like "herbal", "organic", "pure", "natural" and "Ayurvedic" to make the product more appealing.

            <strong>Example:</strong> A face cream branded as “100% Ayurvedic” may contain only one herbal extract, but the label makes it sound pure. In Kerala (India), enforcement agents raided and confiscated Fair & Lovely products, citing misleading claims—specifically the depiction of skin tone conversions (darker to fairer), Ayurvedic care claims without listing related ingredients, and unsubstantiated promises like “clear fairness.” The authorities deemed these products misbranded under the Drugs & Cosmetics Act (1940).
