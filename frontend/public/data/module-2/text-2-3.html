    <div class="paragraph">
        Greenwashing is the action when a company presents its products or practices as more eco-friendly than they actually are to attract environmentally conscious customers. Companies understand that many shoppers prefer sustainable options, so some take advantage of this by using vague claims like "all-natural" or "eco-safe" without proof. Other times, a business may highlight a small green initiative, such as recyclable packaging, while hiding the fact that the overall production process is harmful to the environment. Greenwashing misleads consumers into believing they are making a responsible choice, when in reality the company is exaggerating or fabricating its environmental impact.

    <div class="paragraph indent">
        <strong>1. Ask for proof:</strong> If a company claims their product is "eco-friendly" or "carbon neutral," look for actual data to back it up. Real environmental efforts come with certificates, studies, or specific numbers. No proof usually means no truth.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph indent">
        <strong>2. Watch out for vague buzzwords:</strong> Terms like "natural," "green," or "eco-friendly" sound nice but often mean nothing. Look for specific claims instead - like "made from 80% recycled materials" rather than just "environmentally conscious."
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph indent">
        <strong>3. Check if they actually do what they say:</strong> A truly sustainable company will have a track record of environmental actions, not just marketing slogans. Look up their actual practices - do they use renewable energy, reduce packaging, or have third-party certifications?
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph indent">
        <strong>4. Don't fall for green visuals:</strong> Just because an ad has lots of green colors, nature imagery, or happy animals doesn't mean the product is actually good for the environment. Judge the company by their actions, not their pretty pictures.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph indent">
        <strong>5. Be skeptical of unrealistic promises:</strong> If goals sound too good to be true - like "completely carbon neutral overnight" - they probably are. Real environmental progress takes time and comes with detailed plans on how they'll get there.
