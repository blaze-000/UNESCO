    <div class="paragraph">
        Dark patterns are design tricks used in websites and apps to push users into making choices they might not otherwise make. Companies know that small design changes can influence behavior, so some take advantage of this by hiding important options, making it hard to cancel a subscription, or nudging users toward more expensive choices. Other times, businesses use confusing buttons, pre-checked boxes, or misleading wording to get people to share more data or spend more money. These manipulative tactics exploit human behavior and reduce transparency, leaving consumers feeling trapped or deceived instead of making clear, informed decisions.

    <div class="section-heading">Here are a few common examples of dark patterns:</div>
    
    <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Hidden subscriptions:</strong> Making it easy to sign up but very hard to cancel.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Pre-checked boxes:</strong> Automatically adding extra products or services unless you uncheck them.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Trick wording:</strong> Using confusing language like "Yes, I don't want savings" to pressure you into clicking.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Fake scarcity:</strong> Showing false messages like "Only 1 left in stock!" to rush decisions.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Forced continuity:</strong> Offering a free trial that secretly converts into a paid plan without clear notice.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Disguised ads:</strong> Making ads look like normal content so you click without realizing.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="subsection-heading">Ways to Spot and Avoid Dark Patterns</div>
    
    <div class="paragraph indent">
        <strong>1. Double-check your cart before buying:</strong> Always review your order summary for sneaky add-ons, extra fees, or items you didn't actually want. Companies love slipping in "protection plans" or premium shipping without you noticing.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph indent">
        <strong>2. Pay attention to button colors and design:</strong> If the "cancel" button is tiny and grey while the "buy now" button is huge and bright green, that's intentional. They're trying to trick your eyes into clicking what they want you to click.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph indent">
        <strong>3. Read the fine print:</strong> Look for sneaky checkboxes that automatically sign you up for subscriptions, newsletters, or recurring payments. If something's pre-checked, uncheck it unless you actually want it.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph indent">
        <strong>4. Remember you can always back out:</strong> Until you hit "confirm purchase," you're free to leave. If something feels off, the price suddenly changed, or you feel rushed, just close the website. No purchase is that urgent.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph indent">
        <strong>5. Know how to escape if you got trapped:</strong> If you already fell for dark patterns, act fast. Check the cancellation policy, clearly state you want to cancel (preferably in writing), and don't let them talk you into "better deals" to keep you hooked. You have the right to get out.
