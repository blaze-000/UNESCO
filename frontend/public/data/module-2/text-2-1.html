        <div class="chapter-heading">Fake Discount</div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Fake discount happens when a company tries to attract buyers by advertising a product as being on a huge sale, while in reality it is being sold at its usual price or sometimes even more. Businesses know that shoppers are drawn to bargains, so some exploit this by claiming that items are discounted when they were never actually offered at a higher price to begin with. In other cases, a company might imply that its price is better than a competitor's, even though the competitor's product is not of the same grade or quality, making the comparison misleading.

        <div class="paragraph">
            From January 2021 to late November 2022, Woolworths sold the Oreo Family Pack Original 370g at a regular price of $3.50 under a 'Prices Dropped' promotion. In late November 2022, the price was temporarily raised to $5.00 for three weeks, and then the product was put back on 'Prices Dropped' with a sale price of $4.50, even though this was 29% higher than the original $3.50. In this case, Woolworths appears to have deliberately increased the price to create a higher "was" price, making the subsequent promotion look like a genuine discount, when in fact customers were paying more than the previous regular price.

        <div class="chapter-heading page-break">Urgency & False Scarcity</div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Urgency cues are marketing tactics that push consumers to buy quickly by creating a sense of immediate need. These can appear online, in stores, emails, or on social media. Common examples include time limits, like countdowns or sale end dates, and scarcity messages, such as claims of low stock or high demand. Marketers may also amplify urgency by highlighting what other shoppers are doing.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Fake urgency cues can harm shoppers by pressuring them to make rushed decisions, and they can hurt honest businesses by creating unfair competition. With online shopping growing rapidly, fake urgency cues can spread easily, making it essential for consumers to shop carefully.

        <div class="paragraph">
            They can take different forms, including messages, alerts, pop-ups, or countdown timers.

        <div class="paragraph">
            Here are some common pressure tactics to look out for that may not be truthful:
        </div>

        <ul class="list">
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Limited time offer:</strong> The offer is only available for a limited time or the deal ends soon yet the discounted price continues to be available long after the advertised time limit</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Countdown timer:</strong> The timer runs out or resets but the offer is still available.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Low stock/high demand claims:</strong> "Only 2 left in stock â€“ order soon", "90% of stock is already gone" or "5 other shoppers are also looking at this product right now" but availability does not change over time.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-heading">How to Spot the Difference:</div>

        <ol class="list">
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Check if deadlines are real.</strong> If you see the same "24-hour sale" running for weeks, it's fake. Real sales actually end when they say they will.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Watch those countdown timers.</strong> Legitimate timers don't magically reset after hitting zero. If the timer runs out but the deal stays, you're being manipulated.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Question stock claims.</strong> "Only 3 left!" should mean the number actually goes down as people buy. If it stays at "only 3 left" for days, it's fake.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Look for honest reasons.</strong> Real urgency comes from actual limits - like shipping deadlines or genuine inventory constraints. Vague pressure like "Act now!" without explanation is usually fake.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Trust your gut.</strong> If something feels pushy or too good to be true, take a step back. Real businesses don't need to trick you into buying.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Do a quick check.</strong> Search online to see if others have noticed the same "limited time" offer running forever. Patterns don't lie.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="chapter-heading page-break">Hidden Fees</div>

        <div class="section-heading">How to be Safe:</div>

        <ul class="list">
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Request a breakdown of all potential fees:</strong> Ask for a clear list of all charges, including service fees, delivery costs, installation, or any additional services.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Understand limits and usage restrictions:</strong> Check if there are limits on usage, quantity, or services that could trigger extra charges.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Ask about support or maintenance costs:</strong> Clarify whether there are extra fees for assistance, repairs, updates, or troubleshooting.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Consider future needs:</strong> Understand how costs may change if you expand your purchase, add more items, or increase usage.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Negotiate pricing where possible:</strong> Ask for predictable costs, like fixed rates for services or clear thresholds for extra charges.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Check reviews and testimonials:</strong> Learn from other customers about any hidden fees or unexpected costs that may not be obvious upfront.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="paragraph">
            This approach helps you make informed choices and avoid surprises, ensuring the price you see is closer to the price you pay.
