    <div class="paragraph">
        Fake reviews and endorsements are tactics companies use to make a product or service appear more popular or trustworthy than it really is. Some businesses pay people to leave positive reviews, even if they have never used the product. Others may falsely claim that a celebrity supports their product, using the celebrity's name without permission or suggesting an endorsement that never happened. Social media influencers can also mislead consumers when they promote products without clearly disclosing sponsorships or paid partnerships. These practices give shoppers a false sense of trust, making it harder to know which products are genuinely good and which are being marketed through deception.
