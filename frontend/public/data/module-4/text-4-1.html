    <div class="chapter-heading">1. Watch the fine print</div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      Ads often highlight the good stuff and hide the bad in tiny text,
      asterisks, or vague language. For example, smartphone ad touting "Free
      Screen Replacement" for a year, but in tiny text it states the free
      replacement is only valid for one specific minor crack, excludes battery
      and water damage, and requires customers to pay shipping fees and a costly
      diagnostic charge, making the "free" offer largely misleading.

    <div class="paragraph">
      If the product you get looks nothing like the ad, that’s false
      advertising. A flashy burger on a billboard that turns out tiny and flat
      in real life? Classic case.

    <div class="chapter-heading page-break">3. “Free” isn’t really free.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      If you see “Free trial” or “Buy one, get one free,” check what strings are
      attached—like hidden shipping costs or automatic subscriptions.

      4. Too urgent, too good, too vague.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      If an ad screams “Only today!” or “Best deal ever!” without clear details,
      there you have to be careful. Companies create fake urgency to push you
      into quick decisions. A $500 phone “slashed” to $199 might sound
      amazing—but if it’s always been $199, that’s not a deal, it’s a Trick.

    <div class="subsection-heading">Example</div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      Triangle Media Corporation deceptively advertised "risk-free" trials where
      consumers paid only a small shipping fee but were secretly charged full
      price ($98.71) and enrolled in costly subscriptions without clear consent,
      leading to a $9 million FTC settlement.
