              "The scarcity effect is a psychological phenomenon where people place higher value on things that are scarce.

              "A product being sold at its usual price but advertised as on sale",
            explanation:
              "A fake discount occurs when companies advertise products as being on sale when they're actually sold at their usual price. This tactic artificially inflates the 'original price' to make the current price appear as a discount, misleading consumers about the actual value.",

              "False scarcity tactics like showing 'Only 2 left in stock' when stock remains unchanged are used to create artificial urgency. This exploits the scarcity effect by making consumers believe they'll miss out if they don't act quickly, even when the scarcity is completely fabricated.",
